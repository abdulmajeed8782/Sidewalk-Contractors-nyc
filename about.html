            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Eden Contracting NY was founded with a simple mission: to provide New York City property owners with reliable, high-quality sidewalk repair and concrete services. Based in the Bronx at 3471 Steenwick Ave, we have grown to become one of NYC's most trusted concrete contractors, serving all five boroughs with dedication and expertise.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our journey began with a deep understanding of the unique challenges that NYC sidewalks face. From the harsh winter freeze-thaw cycles to the constant foot traffic of millions of pedestrians, New York City's sidewalks require specialized knowledge and premium materials to ensure longevity and safety.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, we have built our reputation on three core principles: quality workmanship, transparent pricing, and exceptional customer service. These values have made us the go-to choice for property owners throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.</p>
